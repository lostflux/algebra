\begin{problem}
  Let $\phi \colon G \to H$ be a bijective homomorphism, with inverse $\phi^{-1}
  \colon H \to G$.  Show that $\phi^{-1}$ is also a homomorphism.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  What we know (so far):
  \begin{enumroman}
    \item That $\phi$ is a bijection tells us that:
    \begin{enumalph}
      \item $\phi$ is injective --- that is, for every $g_1,g_2 \in G$ such that 
        $\phi(g_1) = \phi(g_2)$, we have $g_1 = g_2$.
      \item $\phi$ is surjective --- that is, for every $h \in H$, there is a $g \in G$
        such that $\phi(g) = h$.
    \end{enumalph}

    \item That $\phi$ is a homomorphism tells us that for every $g_1, g_2 \in G$,
    $\phi(g_1g_2) = \phi(g_1)\phi(g_2)$.
    \item That $\phi^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\phi$ tells us that,
    $\phi^{-1}(\phi(g)) = g$ for every $g \in G$,
    and $\phi(\phi^{-1}(h)) = h$ for every $h \in H$.
  \end{enumroman}

  \noindent
  Next, let's pick two elements $a,b \in G$, and corresponding elements $a',b' \in H$
  such that $\phi(a) = a'$ and $\phi(b) = b'$.

  \noindent
  By property $(3)$ above, $\phi^{-1}(a') = a$
  and $\phi^{-1}(b') = b$.

  \noindent
  By property $(2)$ above, $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b) = a'b'$.

  \noindent
  From this, we aim to show that $\phi^{-1}$ is a homomorphism
  by showing that $\phi^{-1}(a'b') = \phi^{-1}(a')\phi^{-1}(b') = ab$.

  \begin{align*}
    \phi(ab) &= \phi(a)\phi(b) = a'b' \\
    \phi^{-1}(\phi(ab)) &= \phi^{-1}(\phi(a)\phi(b)) = \phi^{-1}(a'b')\; \zaff{\text{(Invert both sides)}} \\
    \phi^{-1}(\phi(ab)) &= \crim{\phi^{-1}(\phi(a))\phi^{-1}(\phi(b))} = \phi^{-1}(a'b')\; \zaff{\text{(By (ii) above)}} \\
    \phi^{-1}(\phi(ab)) &= \crim{\phi^{-1}(a')\phi^{-1}(b')} = \phi^{-1}(a'b')\; \zaff{\text{(Since $\phi(a) = a'$, $\phi(b) = b'$)}} \\
    \crim{ab} &= \phi^{-1}(a')\phi^{-1}(b') = \phi^{-1}(a'b')\; \zaff{\text{(Since $\phi^{-1}(\phi(x)) = x$)}} \\
  \end{align*}

  \noindent
  Thus, we see that $\phi^{-1}(a'b') = \phi^{-1}(a')\phi^{-1}(b') = ab$,
  and $\phi^{-1}$ is a homomorphism.
