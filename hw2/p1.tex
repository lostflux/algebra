  Let $f \colon A \to B$ be a surjective map of sets.  For $y \in B$, let
  \[ f^{-1}(y) \colonequals \{x \in A : f(x) = y\} \]
  be the \emph{preimage} or \emph{fiber} of $f$ over $y$.  (The map $f$ is bijective 
  if and only if $f^{-1}(y)=\{x\}$ consists of a single element $x \in A$, in which 
  case we can define $f^{-1}$ as a function, removing the set brackets.  But we 
  always have fibers.)
  Define a relation by $a \sim b$ if $f(a)=f(b)$.  Show that this relation is an 
  equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are the fibers of $f$.
