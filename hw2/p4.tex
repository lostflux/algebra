\begin{problem}{\textsf{(some of DF 1.6.6)}}
  \begin{enumalph}
  \item Let $\R^\times = \R \smallsetminus \{0\}$ be the set of nonzero real numbers.
  Then $\R^\times$ is a group under multiplication.  Define a second binary operation
  on $\R^\times$ by $x*y=xy/2$ for $x,y \in \R^\times$.  Show that $(\R^\times,*)$ is
  a group, and find an isomorphism $\phi \colon (\R^\times,\cdot) \xrightarrow{\sim} 
  (\R^\times,*)$.  \emph{[Hint: if it helps, write $G=\R^\times$ in the second case 
  with the nonstandard operation.]}
  \item Prove that the groups $\Z$ (under $+$) is not isomorphic to $\Q$ (under $+$).
  \emph{[Remark: there is a bijection from $\Z$ to $\Q$ that is not a homomorphism, 
  and a homomorphism that is not a bijection!]}
