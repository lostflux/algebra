\begin{problem}
  List all ideals of $\Z/12\Z$, and label each indicating
  if it is prime or maximal (or both or neither).
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item $(1) = \Z/12\Z$ is not prime, not maximal since it is the entire $\Z/12\Z$.
    \item $(2) = \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$ is prime and maximal.
    \item $(3) = \{0, 3, 6, 9\}$ is prime and maximal.
    \item $(4) = \{0, 4, 8\}$ is not prime, not maximal.
    \item $(6) = \{0, 6\}$ is not prime, not maximal.
    \item $(0) = \{0\}$ is not prime, not maximal.
  \end{enumalph}
