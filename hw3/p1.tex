  Let $G$ be a group, let $X$ be a set with an action by $G \circlearrowright X$.  
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Prove that the relation $x \sim y$ if $x=g\cdot y$ for some $g \in G$ defines
    an equivalence relation on $X$.  The set of equivalence classes are called the \
    emph{orbits} of $X$ under $G$.  
    \item Show that the multiplicative group $G=\R^\times$ acts on the $xy$-plane $X=\
    R^2$ by $r \cdot (x,y) = (rx,y)$.  What are the orbits of $G$ acting on $X$?  
    Compute the stabilizers of $G$ on the points $(1,1)$ and $(0,0)$.
