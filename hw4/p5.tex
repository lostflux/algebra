  \begin{enumalph}
  \item Fix any labelling of the vertices of a square.
    Use this to identify $D_8$ as a subgroup of $S_4$
    via its action on vertices.
    Prove that the elements of $D_8$ 
    and $\langle (1\ 2\ 3) \rangle$ do not commute in $S_4$.
    \begin{Answer}
      \begin{align*}
        D_8 = \{ 1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3 \}
      \end{align*}
      Let's fix the edges of the square to be labelled $1,2,3,4$
      clockwise from the top-left corner.
      Then, we can identify $D_8$ as a subgroup of $S_4$ via its action on vertices.
      \begin{align*}
        D_8 &\colonequals \{ \epsilon, (1\ 4\ 3\ 2), (1\ 3)(2\ 4), (1\ 2\ 3\ 4),
                            (1\ 4)(2\ 3), (2\ 4), (1\ 2)(3\ 4), (1\ 3) \} \\
      \end{align*}
    \end{Answer}
  \item Prove that $S_4$ does not have a normal subgroup of order $8$.
  \begin{Answer}
    Suppose there exists a normal subgroup $N \trianglelefteq S_4$ of order $8$.
    Then, the quotient group $S_4/N \cong C_3$ is abelian, which implies
    that $N$ contains
    the commutator subgroup of $S_4$, which is $A_4$.
    So, $A_4 \in N$.
    However, $|A_4| = 12$ and $|N| = 8$, so $A_4 \not \in N$.
    This contradiction shows that there cannot exist a normal subgroup of order $8$ in $S_4$.
