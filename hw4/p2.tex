    \item Prove that if $H,K \leq G$ are finite subgroups
    of a group $G$ whose orders are relatively prime,
    then $H \cap K=\{1\}$.
    \begin{Answer}
      Since $H$ and $K$ are finite subgroups of $G$, $H \cap K$ is also a finite subgroup
      of $G$, $H$, and $K$.
      By the Lagrange theorem, we know that $|H \cap K|$ divides $|H|$
      and $|H \cap K|$ divides $|K|$.
      Since $|H|,|K|$ are relatively prime, $|H \cap K|$ must equal $1$,
      and $H \cap K$ must be the trivial subgroup.
    \end{Answer}

    \item Let $n \in \Z_{\geq 1}$.  Use Lagrange's theorem applied to the group
    ${(\Z/n\Z)}^\times$ to prove \emph{Euler's theorem}:
    $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ for all
    $a \in \Z$ with $\gcd{a}{n}=1$.  Conclude \emph{Fermat's little theorem}: if $p$ is 
    a prime, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ for all $a \in \Z$ with $\gcd{a}{p}=1$.
    \begin{Answer}
      We know $|{(\Z/n\Z)}^\times | = \phi(n)$.
      
      \noindent
      Let $a \in {(\Z/n\Z)}$. Given $a \in {(\Z/n\Z)}^\times$,
      we know that $\gcd{a}{n}=1$.

      If we consider the subgroup $\langle a \rangle$ generated by $a$,
      Lagrange's theorem tells us that its order must divide
      the order of ${(\Z/n\Z)}^\times$, which is equal to $\phi(n)$.
      
      Thus, $|a|$ divides $\phi(n)$, and we can write $\phi(n)$ as $x|a|$ for some $x \in \Z$.
      We also know that $a^{|a|} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$. Using this, we can simplify $a^{\phi(n)}$:

      \begin{align*}
        a^{\phi(n)} &= a^{x|a|} \\
                    &= {(a^{|a|})}^x \\
                    &= 1^x \pmod{n} \\
                    &= 1 \pmod{n}
      \end{align*}

      
      Suppose $p$ is prime number,
      we have the special case that $\phi(p) = p-1$,
      in which case $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$
      for all numbers coprime with $p$ --- which
      is every other number in $\Z$ that is not $p$.  
    \end{Answer}
