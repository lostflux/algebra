\section{The Trivial Group}~\label{sec:trivial}

The trivial group $G = \{ \epsilon \}$ has order $n = 1$
and is arguably the least interesting to study.
It contains only a single element, which must be the identity.
Furthermore, any (general) group operation $*$ 
sends the identity right back to itself.
Every group of order $1$ is the trivial group.
