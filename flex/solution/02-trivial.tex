\section{The Trivial Group}~\label{sec:trivial}

The trivial group $G = \{ \epsilon \}$ has order $n = 1$
and is arguably the least interesting to study.
It contains only a single element, which must be the identity for the defined group operation
(since groups must contain the identity element).
Furthermore, any (general) group operation $*$ has the property
$\epsilon * x = x * \epsilon = x$.
In this case, the only option for $x$ in $G$ is $\epsilon$ itself,
so $\epsilon * \epsilon = \epsilon$.
Similarly, $\epsilon^{-1} = \epsilon$, therefore the group
has the identity and is closed is closed under the group operation and inversion,
but it doesn't have any other interesting structures.
