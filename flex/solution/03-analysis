\begin{Answer}
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Show that every nonabelian group $G$ of order $8$ is isomorphic to either 
    $D_8$ or $Q_8$, as follows.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Show that $G$ has an element $a \in G$ of order $4$.  \emph{[Hint: what 
    happens if every nonidentity element has order $2$?]}
    \item Let $H \colonequals \langle a \rangle$ and let $b \not \in H$.  Observe that 
    $H \trianglelefteq G$ is normal; argue that $bab^{-1}=a^3$ (the order under 
    conjugation is preserved), and then that $G \simeq D_4,Q_8$ according as $b$ has 
    order $2$ or $4$.  
    \end{itemize}
    \item Pause to show we have classified groups of order $n \leq 9$.
