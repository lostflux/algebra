\begin{problem}
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
      Show that $R[x]$ is never a field (even if $R$ is a field).
    \item How many polynomials of degree $d$ are there in $(\Z/n\Z)[x]$?  
    \item Show that ${(\Z/8\Z)[x]}^\times > {(\Z/8\Z)}^\times$,
      i.e., there is a unit which is not a scalar unit.
