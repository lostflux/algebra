\begin{problem}{\textsf{(DF 1.2.10)}}
  Let $G$ be the group of rigid motions in $\R^3$ of a cube.  Show that $G$ is a 
  nonabelian group of order $24$.  \emph{[Hint: Find the number of positions to which
  an adjacent pair of vertices can be sent; alternatively, find the number of places 
  to which a given face may be sent and, once a face is fixed, the number of 
  positions to which a vertex on that face may be sent.]}
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item $G = 24$
    
    \noindent
    There are $6$ faces on a cube, and each face has 4 edges.
  
    \noindent
    If we visualize a person placing the cube on a table,
    there are $6$ possible faces that can face the person, and, for each face,
    there are $4$ orientations (or $4$ possible edges that could be touching the table).
    This make for $6 * 4 = 24$ possible positions for the cube.

    \item $G$ is nonabelian
    $G$ has order $24$. For $G$ to be prime, then $|G|$ must either be prime, a square of a prime,
    or a product of two primes $p, q \in \Z, p < q$such that $p \nmid (q - 1)$.
    
    
    \noindent
    However, $|G| = 24 = 2^{3} \cdot 3$ and does not satisfy any of those properties.
