\begin{problem}{(\textsf{DF 4.1.4})}

  \noindent
  Let $S_3$ act on the set $\Omega$ of ordered pairs:
  $\{[i,j] : 1 \leq i,j \leq 3\}$ by $\sigma([i,j])=[\sigma(i),\sigma(j)]$.
  Let's write square brackets around these ordered pairs
  so there is no chance we will get confused between them
  and permutations (we should have been OK since there are commas involved).
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item For each $\sigma \in S_3$ find the cycle decomposition of $\sigma$
      under this action
      (i.e., find its cycle decomposition when $\sigma$ is considered as an 
      element of $S_9$---first fix a labelling of these nine ordered pairs).
      Is the action faithful?
      % \begin{Answer}
      %   The cycle decomposition of $\sigma$ is the same as the cycle decomposition
      %   of $\sigma$ when considered as an element of $S_3$.
      %   The action is faithful since every element of $S_3$ is a cycle.
      % \end{Answer}
    \item Find the orbits of $S_3$ on $\Omega$.
      Is the action transitive?
      % \begin{Answer}
      %   The orbits of $S_3$ on $\Omega$ are the sets of ordered pairs
      %   whose elements occur in a cycle in $S_3$.
      %   with the same first element and the same second element.
      % \end{Answer}
    \item For each orbit $\mathcal{O}$ of $S_3$ acting on these nine points,
      pick some $a \in \mathcal{O}$ and find the stabilizer of $a$ in $S_3$.
      What does this have to do with the orbit-stabilizer lemma
      (DF, Proposition 2, \S 4.1, p.~114)?
